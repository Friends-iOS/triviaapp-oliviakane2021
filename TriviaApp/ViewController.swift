//------------------------------------------------------
//TEACHERS FEEDBACK
//------------------------------------------------------
//DESIGN: LOVE THE DESIGN. VERY COLORFUL, BRIGHT, EASY TO READ AND FRIENDLY
//DESIGN FIXES:
//THE QUESTION LABEL IS SET TO SMALL FOR A MULTIPLE LINES. INCREASED SIZE OF THE LABEL AND ALL OF THE QUESTION'S TEXT CAN BE DISPLAYED WITHOUT CUTTING IT OFF
//EXTRA PROGRESS BAR. VERY EASY FIX TO DELETE EXTRA OBJECTS YOU ARE NOT USING IN YOUR APP
//------------------------------------------------------


//------------------------------------------------------
//RESEARCH: EXCELLENT QUESTIONS - GREAT RESEARCH AND EYE OPENING FACTS!
//RESEARCH FIX: BE SURE TO INCLUDE CITATIONS, ACKS, AND AUTHORSHIP! VERY VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!!
//------------------------------------------------------


//------------------------------------------------------
//CODE: NEARLY GOT EVERYTHING! YOU WERE MISSING SOME PARTS, BUT I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EFFORT YOU PUT INTO THE PROJECT. YOU LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT PROGRAMMING DOING THIS PROJECT SO I HOPE YOU FEEL YOUR EFFORTS WERE WORTH IT!
//CODE FIXES. TO FIX THE CODE YOU CAN DO THE FOLLOWING:
//-----------------------------------------------------
//--------------YES, THERES SOME PROBLEMS. SOME EASY TO SOLVE, SOME DIFFICULT.------------------
//--------------READ THROUGH MY COMMENTS AND LOOK AT THE CODE I CHANGED-------------------
//QUESTION KEEPS UPDATING AFTER USER PRESSES TRUE OR FALSE BUTTONS. THE UPDATEUI() FUNCTION WAS BEING CALLED BY THE TIMER EVERY 0.2 SECONDS. THE ARGUMENT (repeats: true) SHOULD BE CHANGED TO (repeats: false). THUS THE UPDATEUI() FUNCTION WILL ONLY BE CALLED ONCE WHEN THE USER PRESSES TRUE OR FALSE. SEE LINE 138
//CHECKANSWER() WAS MATCHING IF THE BUTTON'S NAME MATCHED THE ANSWER VALUE INSIDE THE ARRAY. THE TRUE AND FALSE BUTTONS ARE NAMED, 'TRUE' AND 'FALSE'...HOWEVER, THE ANSWER VALUE INSIDE THE ARRAY IS NAMED, 'True' AND 'False'. EVEN DIFFERENCES IN CASE MAKE A DIFFERENCE
//TO HAVE THE COLOR CHANGES WORK, YOU MUST CREATE AN IBOUTLET FOR EACH BUTTON AND USE THAT VARIABLE TO CHANGE ITS COLOR. SEE LINES 51 AND 52. ONCE DECLARED WE CAN USE THOSE VARIABLES TO CHANGE INDIVIDUAL BUTTONS. SEE LINES 82 AND 83.
//TO INCREASE SCORE EVERYTIME USER GETS A RIGHT ANSWER, ADD A CALL TO scoreRight IN QUIZBRAIN. SEE LINE 127
//PROGRESS BAR MUST ONLY TAKE A FLOAT. IF YOU DIVIDE TWO INTS YOU GET ANOTHER INT. IF YOU WANT TO DIVIDE TWO INTS AND SAVE IT AS A FLOAT, THEN CAST/CONVERT THE INTS TO FLOATS BEFORE DIVISION AND STORE THE RESULTING VALUE INSIDE OF A FLOAT VARIABLE. SEE LINE 98 IN QUIZBRAIN.
